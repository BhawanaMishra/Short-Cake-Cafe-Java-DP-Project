# Short-Cake-Cafe
*Java Design Pattern Mini Project*
--> Project Insights:
It is a Short Cake Caf√© with 2 types (egg, eggless), 3 flavours (chocolate, mango, strawberry) and 2 toppings(nuts, oreo) with a strict procedure order and fixed rates.
The basic goal is to make the cake and generate bill by developing a user-friendly program using 3 design patterns: Template Method, Simple Factory and Decorator pattern to formulate the task of stating procedure, constructing types and adding flavours and toppings respectively.
The program is definitely open-closed principle specific. Any future accommodations and modifications are kept into the mind and the code can deliver enough scope for future engagements.
